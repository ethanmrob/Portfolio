# Portfolio
My personal portfolio website, designed and developed by me. I'm using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other languages I learn and want to implement along the way. I'm building this as I follow a Web Development course on Udemy, and I'm actively learning and trying to build my skills! I can't wait to see how this turns out!
